IoT Smart Fan Kit

•	Developed an iOS app UI and backend using Swift and SwiftUI that exchanges HTTP requests via REST API endpoints to a web server over Wi-Fi to control the kit – users regulate heat index and perform speed adjustments.

•	Established user authentication utilizing the Google Firebase (NoSQL) database for secure login and registration. Added corresponding UI pages for user login, registration, and a profile view page when logged in.

•	Created a weather UI screen that fetched real-time user location and weather using Core Location API and OpenWeatherMap API.
